QueryReference:

A Query is a request we make to firestone to give us something
from the db

firestone returns us 2 types of object:
    refernces and snapshots
Of these objects, they can be either Document or Collection versions

firestone will always return us these objects, even if nothin exists
from that Query

A QueryReference object is an object that represents the "current" 
place in the db that we are quering.

We get them by calling either: 
firestone.doc('/user/:userId');
firestone.collections('/users');
 
The QueryReference object does not have the actual data of the collection
or Document. It instead has properties that tell us details about it, 
or the method to get the snapshot object which gives us te data we are looking for.
